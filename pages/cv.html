<h1>Curriculum vitae</h1>

<p>Please find a <a href="/andrij-stachurski-resume.pdf">concise resume</a> of the information below if you'd be interested in working together!</p>
			
<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>My industry experience has specialised in web development, systems integration and systems administration. Having qualified with a B.Sc. in Computer Science in 2006 I have worked as a front-end and back-end developer, tutored and trained staff, and installed and maintained server infrastructure for clients globally from Australia and Singapore.</p>

<p>My primary expertise in front-end development comes from building and integrating <a href="/portfolio">numerous interfaces</a> for government departments and multinational organisations under a broad range of technologies and technical environments.</p>

<p>As an original Canberra employee and an early member of the Singapore Reading Room offices I have had considerable experience in setting up and provisioning architecture and in helping recruit and build highly successful award winning development teams.</p>

<p>More recently I've focused my time working with international open source project teams and remotely consulting for a handful of agencies in Australia.</p>
